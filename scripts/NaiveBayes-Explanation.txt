Bayes Theorem:

H - hypothesis
E - evidence

P(H|E) = P(H). P(E|H) / P(E)

P(H) = Probability of hypothesis is true (Before any evidence).

P(E|H) = Probability of seeing the evidence if the hypothesis is true.

P(E) = Probability of seeing the evidence.

P(H|E) = Probability of hypothesis is true given some evidence.
